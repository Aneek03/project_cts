	//fetch= FetchType.LAZY means that the Comment entities will be loaded only when they are explicitly accessed.
	
	
	
//For example, if you have a User entity with many Comment entities associated with it, 
//using FetchType.LAZY for the comments means that JPA wonâ€™t load all the comments from the database when you retrieve a User. 
//Instead, the comments will only be loaded when you actually access them, like calling user.getComments().
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	//In JPA (Java Persistence API), FetchType.LAZY means that the comments associated 
	//with a user will not be loaded immediately. They will be fetched from the database
	//only when they are specifically accessed in the code
